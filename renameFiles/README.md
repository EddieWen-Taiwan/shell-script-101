# Rename file extension

### Usage

```bash
$ node renameFiles.js <folder-path> <prev-ext> <next-ext>
```

#### Example

```bash
$ node renameFiles.js ./example .html .htm
```

Because I got a big problem of switching .jade and .pug files, so I wrote this script. It just renames file's extension simply, I don't think that's a good idea to change image's extenstion with this, like from `.jpg` to `.png`.
